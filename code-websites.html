            Here's some of the websites I've coded/contributed to! I'm linking all of them in their public
            Github repositories, since it's less expensive to just have you download the files and run them in
            something like Visual Studio Code using the Five Server (Live Server) extension, which is how I view
            all of my websites while I'm developing them.

    <h3>BPA Competition Site 2024: Stage Fright</h3>

        This is the first real site I ever made. It was made alongside two other people on my team:
        one designer and one developer. I did much of the style work and structure of many pages on the site.
        This was a submission to Business Professionals of America, and was coded following their prompt,
        which was to make a website based on a small rock band called "Stage Fright." The other developer
        handled pretty much all the scripting, but (almost) all the style was me. We did start with a template,
        which I'll link <a href="">here,</a> but as you can see, we changed a lot of it and really made it our
        own. Honestly, really proud of how this one turned out. I did all the writing for the site, made the About page,
        the News page and all subsequent article pages, the Home page, the Contact page, and the Discography page, as well
        as all subsequent album pages with their songs on them. All of this was done in around six months or so, maybe a little bit less.
