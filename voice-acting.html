            Hi there! I haven't actually voice acted in any projects yet, but I'm hoping to soon
            and to build a portfolio with it eventually! If you contact me now regarding roles, actually, I'd be
            perfectly willing (and more than excited) to voice something for free! I'd take the experience and portfolio-building
            as payment enough! The most reliable way to contact me regarding voice acting is my email, and for long-term contact,
            my Discord, which I can share upon request.
