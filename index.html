                <p>If you're reading this, it means you're potentially considering me for a job.
                    This is excellent news! Thank you so much! But wait a minute, what is this?<br><br>
                    Great question, glad you asked! This is my portfolio for a great deal of things!<br><br>
                    You see, I'm a jack of many trades. Coding, voice acting, art, writing, I've got a ton of skills!
                    So, naturally, I need a place to put all of them for potential employers. This is what that functions as!<br><br>
                    Most people would simply do a folder of their art, a video reel of their roles, or the names of what projects they've worked on.
                    I feel this is more fitting though, simply because I do so much. Now everything's in one place! You can navigate to the segments
                    of my portfolio that you're considering me for. If you're looking for my vocal performances, art, or writing, they're all here,
                    simply hidden from view on different pages.<br><br>
                    As for the coding, well, you're already seeing a bit of my work! I've coded this website myself, from the ground up, with zero templates.
                    Just me, my brain, and whatever languages I've integrated. Here! I'll even list them for you! This way, I can add more if I integrate more.
                </p>
                <ul>Languages this website was built with:
                    <li>HTML</li>
                    <li>CSS</li>
                    <li>JavaScript</li>
                </ul>
                <p>There they are! How exciting! Oh, and if you're considering me for code, I'll go ahead and separate the site into a few different areas!
                    I'll make separate sections for web development and game development. Heck, maybe even software or system development if I actually end up doing that.
